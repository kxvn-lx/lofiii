## Why?
Because why not? lol - in a more serious manner, it's because as a developer, having a lot of browser tabs can really have an impact on the machine
(especially if you have a potato machine). Therefore, I created this native lightweight app to increase the performance, and reduce workload of your beloved browser.

## Download
If you wanted to get your hands dirty, go ahead and clone this repo and compile it yourself. But if you're lazy, simply head to the [website](https://kevinweb.tech/lofiii/), download, and move it to your application folder.
