Chilledcow's lofi hiphop livestream straight from your mac - natively.

## Why?
Because why not? lol - in a more serious manner, it's because as a developer, having a lot of browser tabs can really have an impact on the machine
(especially if you have a potato machine). Therefore, I created this native lightweight app to increase the performance, and reduce workload of your beloved browser.
